```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Print 1 to 10

The following codes will print **1 to 10**. ##Using For --- Loop You can use a for loop to write a better code, for example:

```{r}
for (x in 1:10)
  print(x)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
